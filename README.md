- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- SARIMAX
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Project Features
- Time-series based electricity demand forecasting
- Feature engineering using lag variables and rolling averages
- Comparison of multiple forecasting models
- Visualization of actual vs predicted energy demand

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
2. Feature engineering (lags, rolling averages, time-based features)  
3. Model training using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SARIMAX  
4. Model evaluation and performance comparison  
5. Result visualization and analysis  

## Results
The implemented models demonstrate effective forecasting performance and highlight the usefulness of machine learning techniques for real-world energy demand prediction.
